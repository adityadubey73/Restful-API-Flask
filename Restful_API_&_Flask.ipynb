        "> A RESTful API, or REST API, is a way for computer systems to exchange information over the internet. It's based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, which uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. Essentially, it provides a set of rules for how clients and servers should communicate when accessing and manipulating data.\n",

It defines a set or rules/constraints for a web application to send and receive data. In this article, we will build a REST API in Python using the Flask framework. Flask is a popular micro framework for building web applications. Since it is a micro-framework, it is very easy to use and lacks most of the advanced functionality which is found in a full-fledged framework. Therefore, building a REST API in Flask is very simple.

Each resource can have several methods associated with it such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. for example, there could be a resource that calculates the square of a number whenever a get request is sent to it. Each resource is a class that inherits from the Resource class of flask_restful. Once the resource is created and defined, we can add our custom resource to the api and specify a URL path for that corresponding resource.\n",
